Hi, I'm Claire.\
I'm a 2nd year software engineering student who loves rabbits 🐰, gothic/dark academia aesthetics 🖤, music 🎧, and video games 🕹️(Fromsoftware games in particular).

My github project are mainly small projects built to help me learn new languages and skills such as web development. I currently have two projects underway, the first is a [typing test website](https://github.com/pbertone20/Typing-Test-Website) created in collaboration with Peter Bertone and the second is a personal portfolio website.
