Hi, I'm Claire. I'm a 2nd year software engineering student. My github project are mainly small projects built to help me learn new languages and skills such as web development. I currently have two projects underway, the first is a [typing test website](https://github.com/pbertone20/Typing-Test-Website) created in collaboration with Peter Bertone and the second is a personal portfolio website.
