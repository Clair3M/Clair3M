Hi, I'm Claire. 
I'm a 2nd year software engineering student who loves rabbits, music, and video games (Fromsoftware games in particular).

My github project are mainly small projects built to help me learn new languages and skills such as web development. 
I currently have two projects underway, the first is a [typing test website](https://github.com/pbertone20/Typing-Test-Website) created in collaboration with Peter Bertone and the second is a personal portfolio website.
